# omo-ultrawork

English | [简体中文](README.zh.md)

[oh-my-openagent](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent) (OmO)'s ultrawork workflow, adapted for OMP. Typing `ulw` in a message switches the agent into outcome-first execution: it delivers the request end to end and backs each success criterion with evidence observed on the real surface. The plugin also adds `mass-ulw` for dependency-ordered fan-out, `/hyperplan` for adversarial planning, and `/ulw-research` for cited research reports.

## Install

```bash
omp plugin install omo-ultrawork@wows-omp-plugins
```

Requires OMP 18.5.1 or newer. `/ulw-research` also needs `node` on `PATH` to build its report. Restart the session after installing.

## Quick start

```text
ulw fix the flaky upload test and make CI green
/ulw                               # keep ultrawork on for every message
/hyperplan migrate auth to OAuth   # debate a plan before writing it
/ulw-research compare SQLite WAL and rollback journal for our workload
```

The first reply in ultrawork mode starts with `ULTRAWORK MODE ENABLED!`, and the footer shows `Ultrawork armed` or `Ultrawork mode`.

## Usage

### Ultrawork mode

Typing `ulw` or `ultrawork` as a standalone word injects the hidden ultrawork directive ahead of your message. Later triggers in the same session add only a short reminder, since the directive is still in context; after compaction the full directive comes back on the next trigger. Keywords inside inline code, fenced blocks and slash commands do not count.

`/ultrawork` or `/ulw` turns on persistent mode, so every message gets ultrawork without a keyword. Run either command again to turn it off. `/ultrawork <request>` turns the mode on and sends the request as your next message.

The footer shows `Ultrawork mode` while persistent mode is on and `Ultrawork armed` after a keyword trigger. Mode and arming are saved in the session and restored on resume, switching, branching and tree navigation.

OmO documents the original in [Ultrawork Mode](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/blob/fe427efeed97e95f009dc6ca7fb17a3ac857f79f/docs/guide/overview.md#ultrawork-mode-for-the-lazy).

### Do not combine with `orchestrate`

OMP's built-in `orchestrate` keyword injects its own rules, which contradict ultrawork on commits, verification and delegation. When a message contains an `orchestrate` that OMP would act on, this plugin injects nothing for that message and shows a warning; persistent mode resumes with the next message. `/ultrawork orchestrate …` refuses to turn on persistent mode. If you use ultrawork regularly, disable the built-in keyword:

```bash
omp config set magicKeywords.orchestrate false
```

### mass-ulw

`mass-ulw` is a skill for running a dependency graph of subagent tasks (`{ id, prompt, agent, dependsOn?, label? }`) through `eval`. It validates ids, dependencies and cycles before launching anything, runs one batch of ready nodes at a time, and reads their reports before the next batch. A final verification step checks the evidence, since a finished child is not yet accepted work. Status and reports survive a kernel reset.

Typing `mass ulw`, `mass-ulw`, `ulw-mass`, `mulw` or `meth` points the agent at the skill; `mulw` and `meth` do not arm ultrawork on their own. For independent work without dependencies, one plain `task` batch is simpler.

OmO documents the original in [Dependency graphs: mass-ulw](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/blob/fe427efeed97e95f009dc6ca7fb17a3ac857f79f/docs/guide/orchestration.md#dependency-graphs-mass-ulw).

### /hyperplan

`/hyperplan <request>` runs a three-round adversarial debate among five critics, each attacking the draft from one side: needless complexity and scope creep, integration gaps and edge cases, unverified assumptions, architectural flaws, and missed alternatives. A separate planner then turns the outcome into a plan. Its first line is `HYPERPLAN MODE ENABLED!`.

OmO documents the original in [Adversarial alternative: /hyperplan](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/blob/fe427efeed97e95f009dc6ca7fb17a3ac857f79f/docs/guide/orchestration.md#adversarial-alternative-hyperplan).

### /ulw-research

`/ulw-research <request>` builds a claim graph through expansion and counter-search, writes a cited synthesis, runs ordered QA gates and checks the deliverable. Scratch files go to `<tmpdir>/ulw-research/` or `researchScratchDir`; the final report goes wherever you asked. Its first line is `ULW-RESEARCH MODE ENABLED!`.

OmO documents the original under `ulw-research` in [Built-in Skill Sets](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/blob/fe427efeed97e95f009dc6ca7fb17a3ac857f79f/docs/reference/features.md#built-in-skill-sets).

Both commands reject an empty request and run only in the main session.

## Settings

Package name for `omp plugin config`: `wows-omp-plugin-omo-ultrawork`.

```bash
omp plugin config list wows-omp-plugin-omo-ultrawork
omp plugin config set wows-omp-plugin-omo-ultrawork keywordTrigger false
omp plugin config set wows-omp-plugin-omo-ultrawork keywords 'focus,ship'
omp plugin config set wows-omp-plugin-omo-ultrawork researchScratchDir /tmp/my-research
```

| Setting | Type | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `keywordTrigger` | boolean | `true` | When false, typed keywords do not trigger ultrawork. The `mass-ulw` pointer and the commands still work. |
| `keywords` | comma-separated string | `ulw,ultrawork` | Case-insensitive whole-word triggers. An empty string disables keyword triggering. |
| `researchScratchDir` | string | empty (`<tmpdir>/ulw-research`) | Root for research scratch files. Relative paths resolve against the session's working directory. |

Settings are read at session start and on session switch, so restart the session after changing them.

## Working with other plugins

- With `omo-toolkit` installed, `/hyperplan` and `/ulw-research` use its category agents (`deep-low`, `ultrabrain`, `artistry`, `librarian`, `writing`); without it they fall back to `task` and `scout`, and every command still works.
- With `omo-prometheus` installed, ultrawork defers to an approved `/prometheus` plan instead of writing its own.

## Without the terminal UI

The keyword and all commands work in RPC, ACP editors, the SDK and headless runs; none of them needs a dialog. Without a UI, usage errors and mode changes appear as visible session messages.

Client programs can read the mode from a state snapshot; see the [reference](REFERENCE.md#state-snapshot).

## Known limitations

- Keywords in messages generated by extensions, and in child sessions, are ignored.
- The `/hyperplan` and `/ulw-research` procedures are private prompts, not skills, so neither you nor the model can open them through `skill://` or `/skill:`. `mass-ulw` is the only skill this plugin exposes.
- Upgrading the plugin removes the installed copy a running session loaded, so `/ulw-research` reports that its scripts are gone until you restart OMP. The other prompts are read when the plugin loads and keep working.
